	\begin{abstract}
This document provides a \LaTeX \ template for \emph{IISE Transactions}. Your paper should be compiled in the following order: title; abstract; keywords; main text, including an introduction and a conclusion or summary; acknowledgments; declaration of interest statement; references; appendices (as appropriate). Figures and tables should be inserted into the text as close to first mention as possible (NOT appended to the end of the manuscript). In-text citations and the reference list must follow \emph{IISE Transactions} guidelines. Use 11 point font, 1 inch margins, and double-spacing for the manuscript. A typical paper for this journal should be no more than 30 pages in manuscript format, counting from the title page to references. Appendices should be included as supplemental online materials. Do not use footnotes. \emph{IISE Transactions} uses a double-blind review process. Please make sure that you submit the \textbf{blind version} of your manuscript, which does not contain any information identifying the authors.  This includes removing the authors information on the title page as well as the information that may be identifying in the Acknowledgment section. \\

\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.07,1.00}{We strongly encourage authors to address the following three questions in their \textbf{abstract}, preferably following the order shown: (1) Research problem statement: what is the research problem to be addressed? (2) Methods and results: how do the authors address the research problem and what are the main results? (3) Insights and implications:  What have the authors learned (as opposed to what they did, which is covered in point (2)) from conducting this research? What is the knowledge gained and why does it matter? The abstract should be written in \textbf{a single paragraph}.}.\\

We thank you for your attention to these details.

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Response} \label{s:response}
Some of the petitions have return objects. Those petitions will return to the sender (TesterConnector) with the same code, but with a '1' on the Response parameter. In that case, the parameter \hyperref[s:dst]{Destiny} now means 'Origin'.

Some petitions have \gls{async} "returns" (for example: \myworries{examples}). Those will be sent using petitions without return's \hyperref[s:type]{Type} (so, petitions without a mirror petition with a '1' as Response), marked as responses (Response bit at '1').

\subsection{Type} \label{s:type}
The Type parameter specifies the desired request. Those change according to the \hyperref[s:dst]{Destiny}, so they will be discussed in more detail in their respective sections.

The only exception is the all-zeroes type (0b000000000000) which represents a \gls{NOP} request. That way, if you need to perform a long test, you won't be \myworries{explain the 'kicked by inactivity' concept} kicked by inactivity if you send this request every few minutes.

\subsection{Arguments} \label{s:args}
The Arguments parameter specifies the arguments (if any) to the \textit{\hyperref[s:type]{Type}} request. Those change according to the \hyperref[s:dst]{Destiny}, so the amount of arguments, and their types and order will be discussed in more detail in their respective sections.

Now there will be discussed the most common data types, so they will be independent of any programming language.

\subsubsection{Character}\label{type:char}
Characters are sent as a 1-byte integer, representing its ASCII \myworries{ref?} value.

\subsubsection{Integer}\label{type:int}
Integers are signed 4-bytes integers.

\subsubsection{Float}\label{type:float}
Floats are 4-bytes floating-point numbers. They are represented following the \gls{IEEE-754}.

\subsubsection{Strings}\label{type:str}
Strings are \hyperref[type:array]{arrays} of \hyperref[type:char]{characters}. Refer to the respective subsections for more information.

\subsubsection{Array}\label{type:array}
Arrays are a set of \textit{n} elements of the same type.

The structure is a 2-byte \myworries{big endian?} integer (representing the number of elements, \textit{n}), followed by \textit{n} elements of the same type. As a note here, by representing the size with a 2-byte integer the maximum number of elements per array is 65,535.

	\bitheader{0,15,16,23,24,31} \\
	\bitbox{16}{size} & \bitbox{8}{char[0]} & \bitbox{8}{char[1]} \\

\end{cbytefield}
\myworries{label} Structure of a \hyperref[type:str]{String}.

Arrays can be multidimensional \myworries{define?}, holding \textit{n} arrays of the same type. It's worth mentioning that they don't have to be arrays of the same length:
\begin{cbytefield}{32}
	\bitheader{0,15,16,23,24,31} \\
	\bitbox{16}{2 [number of arrays]} & \bitbox{16}{5 [str[0]'s length]} \\
	\bitbox{8}{h} & \bitbox{8}{e} & \bitbox{8}{l} & \bitbox{8}{l} \\
	\bitbox{8}{o} & \bitbox{16}{6 [str[1]'s length]} & \bitbox{8}{w} \\
	\bitbox{8}{o} & \bitbox{8}{r} & \bitbox{8}{l} & \bitbox{8}{d} \\
	\bitbox{8}{!} & \bitbox{24}[bgcolor=lightgray]{next type}
\end{cbytefield}
